# Introduction

<p>A basic yet useful guide for all that you need to know about <b>PrimParity</b></p>

- ## What is **PrimParity**?

The core defination and name "PrimParity" comes from two words:<br>Primality and Parity.

> **Primality:** It refers to the property of a positive integer that can only be divided by 1 and itself without leaving a remainder. Such numbers are called prime numbers, and they play a fundamental role in number theory and various fields of mathematics and computer science.

> **Parity:** It refers to the evenness or oddness of an integer. An integer is said to be even if it is divisible by 2, and odd if it is not divisible by 2. Parity is an important concept in various areas of mathematics and computer science, including number theory, algebra, and coding theory.

This package returns value ```type: boolean``` depending on the number's parity (odd/even) and primality (prime/composite). Also checks if integer does not exceed the **JavaScript MAXIMUM_SAFE_INTEGER**.
